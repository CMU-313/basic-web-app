## Getting Started

First install the app:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api?q=shakespeare](http://localhost:3000/api?q=shakespeare). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/index.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Testing

The repo uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing. Current there's one test file for `QueryProcessor` helper, called `_tests_/QueryProcessor.test.ts`.

To run tests, run the following command

```bash
npm run test
```

Jest will run in watch mode, which means it will automatically run your test case as you make changes to your code.
